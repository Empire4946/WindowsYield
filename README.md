# WindowsYield

WindowsYield is an advanced script executor with additional bypasses that enhance its functionality compared to traditional script executors like Infinite Yield. It provides several bypasses to overcome common limitations and restrictions imposed by Roblox.

## Features

- **CollectGarbage/GCInfo Bypass (Realistic):** WindowsYield incorporates a bypass for CollectGarbage and GCInfo functions, allowing you to manipulate and control memory usage more effectively. This bypass provides a realistic approach to memory management in Roblox.

- **Memory Spoofer (Realistic):** With the Memory Spoofer bypass, WindowsYield can modify and manipulate memory usage. This bypass adds another layer of realism to memory-related operations.

- **DecendantAdded Bypass:** The DecendantAdded bypass allows WindowsYield to bypass the normal checks and restrictions imposed when manipulating or accessing objects in the game hierarchy. This bypass gives you more freedom and flexibility in interacting with the game's objects.

- **ContentProvider Bypass:** The ContentProvider bypass in WindowsYield overcomes the limitations set by Roblox's ContentProvider service. It randomizes the preloading process for CoreGui and game assets, providing a more efficient and flexible way to preload assets without triggering detection mechanisms.

- **GetFocusedTextBox Bypass (Lego Hacker):** WindowsYield includes a bypass for the GetFocusedTextBox function in the UserInputService, allowing you to retrieve the focused TextBox even in cases where it's protected or inaccessible. This bypass expands the capabilities of script execution and interaction with user input.

- **NewProxy Bypass (Lego Hacker):** The NewProxy bypass in WindowsYield enables you to create proxies without triggering detection mechanisms. This bypass adds an extra layer of stealth and security to your scripting activities.
